    "Hi everyone.  These are the exercises for the first set of readings from ThinkPython.  While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

Additionally, in order to write text in this document, you will be making use of markdown cells.

    "\n",
    "####  - best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science\n",
    "####  - teaches problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - computers can only run programs written in low-level languages \n",
    "#### - disadvantage of high-level languages: must be processed before they run\n",
    "#### - advantages of high-level languages: easier to program, shorter and easier to read, can run on different types of computers\n",
    "#### - disadvantage of low-level programs: can only run on one type of computer\n",
    "#### - advantage of low-level programs: does not have to be processed like a high-level language needs to be\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - programs that process h-l to l-l: interpreters and compilers\n",
    "#### - interpreters: reads h-l and executes it\n",
    "#### - compilers: read and translates it completely nefore executing\n",
    "#### - ways to be interpreter: interactive mode and script mode\n",
    "#### - can store code in a script\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 What is a Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - program: sequence of instructions that shows how to do a computation\n",
    "#### - basic instructions: input, output, math, conditional execution (checking for certain conditions), repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 What is Debugging?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - bugs are programming errors\n",
    "#### - three types of errors: syntax (structure problems), runtime (error appears after program starts running), and semantic (no error messages, but incorrect result)\n",
    "#### - debugging is like detective work and experimental science\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Formal and Natural Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - natural languages: the ones people speak\n",
    "#### - formal languages: made by people for specific purposes\n",
    "#### - natural and formal features in common: tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics\n",
    "#### - differences: natural languages have ambiguity, redundancy, and metaphor/idiom\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 The First Program \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - print statement - displays something: \n",
    "#### - print 'Hello, World!' --> Hello, World!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Debugging \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - make small mistakes now to become familiar with the error messages \n",
