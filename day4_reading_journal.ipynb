    "# Chapter 10: Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 A List is a Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - list: sequence of values\n",
    "#### - elements/items: values in a list\n",
    "#### - nested list: a list within another\n",
    "#### ex) [3, 5, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 Lists are Mutable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - accessing elements of a list is the same syntax of a string (word[1])\n",
    "#### - lists a mutable - you can change them\n",
    "#### - mapping: relationship between indices and elements\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3 Traversing a List\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - most common way to traverse elements of a list is with a for loop\n",
    "#### - combining range and len functions to update\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.4 List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - add lists using + sign - multiply with * sign\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.5 List Slices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - slice operator works on lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.6 List Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - append adds a new element to the end of a list - listname.append('d')\n",
    "#### - extend takes a list as an arguments and appends all the elements - listname.estend(secondlist)\n",
    "#### - sort arrances from low to high \n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.7 Map, Filter and Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - augmented assignment statement: total += x is the same thing as total = total + x\n",
    "#### - accumulator: a variable used to sum elements as a loop executes\n",
    "#### - built in sum function to add the elements of a list - sometimes called reduce because it condences\n",
    "#### - filter: selects some elements and filters out others\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.8 Deleting Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - t = ['a', 'b', 'c'] => x= t.pop(1) => print t => ['a', 'c'] => print x => b\n",
    "#### - if you don't need the removed value - del t[1] => print t => ['a', 'c'] \n",
    "#### - if you know the element but not the index - t.remove('b') => print t => ['a', 'c']\n",
    "#### - to remove more than one element - del t[0:2] => print t => ['c']\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.9 Lists and Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - to convert a string to a list of individual letters:\n",
    "####                - s = 'spam => t = list(s) => print t => ['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\n",
    "#### - to convert a string to a list of words:\n",
    "####                - s = 'pining for' => t = s.split() => print t => ['pining', 'for']\n",
    "#### - a delimiter deletes a certain character\n",
    "####                - s = 'spam-spam' => delimiter = '-' => a.split(delimiter) => ['spam', 'spam']\n",
    "#### - join is the inverse of split\n",
    "####                - t = ['pining', 'for'] => delimiter ' ' => delimiter.join(t) => 'pining for'\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.10 Objects and Values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - to check whether variable refer to the same object: a is b => True or False\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.11 Aliasing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - if you assign b=a, then both variable refer to the same object\n",
    "#### - reference: the association of a variable with an object\n",
    "#### - aliased: object with more than one reference has more than one name\n",
    "#### - safer to aviod aliasing because it is error prone\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.12 List Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - delete_head removes the first element from a list\n",
    "#### - you can use the + to add to a list\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.13 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - dont forget that most lists methods modify the argument and return None\n",
    "#### - Pick an idion and stick with it - choose one method \n",
    "#### - Make copies to avoid aliasing\n",

You start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are looking for comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, then you search the first half of the list the same way. Otherwise you search the second half.\n",
